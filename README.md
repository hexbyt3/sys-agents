# Less effective
@bug-hunter fix the crash
```

### 3. **Leverage Agent Expertise**
```bash
# Use pokemon-specialist for game mechanics
@pokemon-specialist what's the best way to detect shiny Pokemon in memory?

# Use security-auditor for vulnerabilities
@security-auditor review this user input handling code
```

```bash
# Weekly security review
@security-auditor scan for new vulnerabilities

# Monthly performance check
@csharp-optimizer analyze performance bottlenecks

# Before each release
@csharp-reviewer comprehensive review
@bug-hunter regression testing
```

## üéØ Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Performance Degradation
```bash
# User reports: "Bot is slow after running for a few hours"
@bug-hunter investigate memory leaks or resource exhaustion
@csharp-optimizer profile and optimize the hot paths
@refactoring-expert restructure if architectural issues found
```

### Scenario 2: Adding Multi-Game Support

```

## üí° Tips & Tricks

### 1. **Agent Combinations**
Some agents work exceptionally well together:
- **bug-hunter + csharp-optimizer**: For fixing performance bugs
- **pokemon-specialist + feature-developer**: For game-specific features
- **refactoring-expert + security-auditor**: For secure architecture

### 2. **Context Preservation**
```bash
# Start a session with context
@csharp-reviewer we're working on the trade queue system today
# All subsequent reviews will consider this context
```

### 3. **Incremental Improvements**
```bash
# Don't try to fix everything at once
@refactoring-expert focus only on the TradeModule class for now
```

### 4. **Learning from Agents**
```bash
# Ask agents to explain their reasoning
@csharp-optimizer explain why Span<T> is better here
@security-auditor what makes this pattern vulnerable?
```

### 5. **Custom Workflows**
Create your own agent combinations for specific needs:
```bash
# For a new developer
@csharp-reviewer + @bug-hunter provide educational feedback

# For production hotfix
@bug-hunter + @security-auditor quick fix with minimal risk

# For feature planning
@pokemon-specialist + @feature-developer feasibility analysis
```

## üö® Important Notes

1. **Always run csharp-reviewer** after significant changes
2. **Security-auditor** should review anything touching user data
3. **Bug-hunter** is essential before releases
4. **Pokemon-specialist** must validate game-specific changes
5. **Test changes** in a safe environment first

## üìà Measuring Success

Track these metrics to ensure agents are helping:
- **Reduced bug count** (bug-hunter effectiveness)
- **Performance improvements** (csharp-optimizer impact)
- **Security incidents** (security-auditor value)
- **Code quality scores** (csharp-reviewer + refactoring-expert)
- **Feature delivery speed** (feature-developer efficiency)
- **User satisfaction** (winforms-enhancer success)
