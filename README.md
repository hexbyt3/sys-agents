## üéØ How to Invoke Agents

### Basic Invocation

To use an agent, simply mention their specific use case in your request to Claude:

```
"I need help debugging a race condition in my trade queue"
‚Üí Claude will automatically invoke the bug-hunter agent
```

### Direct Invocation

You can also explicitly request a specific agent:

```
"Use the security-auditor agent to review my Discord command implementation"
```

### Multiple Agent Collaboration

For complex tasks, Claude can coordinate multiple agents:

```
"I want to add a new batch trading feature with proper security and performance optimization"
‚Üí May invoke feature-developer, security-auditor, and csharp-optimizer agents
```

## üí° Usage Examples

### Example 1: Debugging a Complex Issue
```
User: "My bot randomly disconnects during trades and the UI stops updating"

2. Invoke security-auditor to ensure secure permission checking
3. Have csharp-reviewer validate the approach
```

### Example 3: Performance Optimization
```
User: "Box operations are slow when searching for specific Pokemon"

Claude will:
1. Use pokemon-specialist for game-specific optimizations
2. Invoke csharp-optimizer for general performance improvements
3. Suggest caching strategies and parallel processing
```

## üèÜ Best Practices

### 1. **Be Specific**
The more specific your request, the better the agent can help:
- ‚ùå "Fix my code"
- ‚úÖ "Fix the memory leak in my trade queue that occurs after 100+ trades"

### 2. **Provide Context**
Include relevant information:
- Which game (SV, SWSH, BDSP, etc.)
- Which component (Discord bot, WinForms UI, trade logic)
- Error messages or symptoms

### 3. **Use Multiple Agents**
Don't hesitate to request multiple perspectives:
```
"Implement a new feature and have it reviewed for security and performance"
```

### 4. **Follow Agent Recommendations**
Each agent provides specific output formats and checklists - use them to ensure completeness.

### 5. **Test Incrementally**
When implementing agent suggestions:
1. Make changes incrementally
2. Test after each change
3. Use the provided test cases
4. Monitor performance metrics
